								For a brief background about myself, for as long as I can remember, I have been very interested and curious about our universe. 
								Naturally, from this interest, I fell in love with science. Through science, we are able to learn more about the world around us and why
								we perceive (or don't perceive) things the way that we do. It has always felt to me like science is about
								exploring the unknown to find answers to our deepest questions, and at least to some extent, I think everyone
								can relate to such a desire for exploration. Although my major is in Physics and minor in Computer Science, I 
								find developing myself in other sciences to be enjoyable and try to learn as much as I can in regards to areas
								of chemistry, biology, and so forth when I can. Whether it be through research, or through work, I hope to be able
								to develop myself and learn more about myself and our mysterious universe for the rest of my life.

								With regards to academic background highlights,
								I am currently a transfer student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a major in 
								Engineering Physics and a minor in Computer Science. Areas of focus include Computational Physics, although
								I am also very interested in exploring more in Quantum Computing than what has been covered in my coursework.
								After graduation, I plan to work in computer-science research and software development.
