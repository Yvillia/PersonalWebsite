						I am currently a transfer student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
						I am majoring in Engineering Physics and currently plan 
						to minor in both Computer Science and Mathematics. 
						I am interested in Quantum Computing and Computational Physics,
						and I plan to work in research and computer programming after 
						graduating. I have also worked on several programming projects 
						such as a Java game engine and GUI (Graphical User Interface), a club 
						website, a password security, one-way encryption application, 
						and a Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning project with ASL 
						(American Sign Language) image to text recognition. I have previously 
						interned as a Work Instructions Creator at Custom Power Products, where 
						I served as technology support for new machinery and programs.
