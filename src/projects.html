							The GUI includes settings and personalization abilities such as choice of

							still needs to be connected to a backend in terms of allowing it to be used
							for game functionality.

						Basically the app allows one to type in an algebraic expression that will then show steps on how to
						simplify the expression into simplest form by using a Binary Expression Tree to produce a thorough solution. 
						The app also supports differentiation and integration via the use of Wolfram Alpha's API,
						but these techniques do not show steps yet.</li>
