						<li class = "description"><b>Summary: </b> At Statefarm, during the Summer of 2020, Fall of 2020, and Spring of 2021, I worked as an 
						Enterprise Technology Intern, which functioned primarily as a Software Developer Intern.

						<li class = "description"><b>Summer 2020: </b></li>
						For Summer of 2020, I worked heavily with Dev/Ops
						ideologies such as CaaS (Containers as a Service) which utilized a combination of Kubernetes and Docker to create a container that ran code for 
						a reactive monitoring service that I also assisted with improving. The code utilized within the containers utilized PostgreSQL for database access,
						JavaScript for Frontend and Backend Communication, and HTML & CSS for appearance. To maintain the containers, we utilized NGINX to serve as our proxy
						and scalability service.
						<br>
						<li class = "description"><b>Fall 2020 & Spring 2021: </b></li>
						
						For Fall of 2020 and Spring of 2021, I worked with a variety of different tools relating to bookkeeping of clientele. With this work, I utilized languages
						and tools such as Gradle (for building projects and running security scans), Java (used as main language with springboot framework), RabbitMQ (for retrieving and using 
						data collected from our APIs and integrating the data into test projects), and a variety of odd tasks and ends such as setting up Grafana Monitoring Dashboards for projects.
						During this time period, I was treated as a part of the team I was working on as a full software developer who completed tasks using Agile Methodology through sprint planning, scrumboards, and
						retrospectives through tools such as Version1 and Git.
